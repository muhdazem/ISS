## Hey there!
If you try to simply download this project and try to run it, the Map won't be visible or you can't see the Map Tiles.<br/>Inorder to make this map work fine, you need an API "accessToken" from Mapbox.<br/><br/>To get your Mapbox API "accessToken":<br/>1). visit here--> https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/ (do Signup or SignIn).<br/>2). After going through all the process of Signup or SignIn, you will be able to see your API accessToken under "Default public token" in the main page of Mapbox.<br/>3). Now pick your "accessToken" aka "Default public token" and find and replace this line 'your.mapbox.access.token' inside script.js file with your accessToken.<br/>4). Now the ISS Tracker will work fine :) <br/><br/> If you are only seeing blue color inside your map, fear not, Your ISS is now flying over oceans. So scroll back with your mouse to zoom out of the map then you will start seeing other places!
